 This code is used to reconstruct the 3D tomography of dislocation loops
 in ion irradiated metals. 

 The example TEM dark field images were acquired by Xiaoou Yi at IVEM, Argonne National Labtory.
 The sample is high purity tungsten (99.99%) thin foil irradiated by 150 kv 
 self ions at 30 K. The data was acquired at 300 k.

To make the code work, make sure the 'bin' folder was included in the path.

Images requirement :
TEM bright filed or dark field images acquired under the same diffraction condition,
that is, the g vector and the deviation parameter are maintained same during tilting. 

The TEM Setup:
The titling axis in the frame of the CCD camera must be calibrated. 

 Before running the code, please go through the input parameters
